Consider the language:

$CONTAINSPAL_{CFG} =$
	\[  \{ \langle G \rangle ~|~ G \mbox{ is a DFG and } ww^R \in L(G) \mbox{ for some } w \in \Sigma_G^* \}
	\]	
	Determine whether this language is decidable, undecidable but recognizable, not recognizable but has a recognizable complement or that neither the language or its complement is recognizable. 
	
	Warning: This problem looks a lot like the two preceding questions, but its solution is probably much more challenging.
	
	You should justify your conclusion for this and
	each of the two preceding questions by either showing an
	algorithm to decide the language, showing an algorithm to recognize the language (or its complement) and using a
	reduction argument to show that the complement (or the language) is not recognizable or providing an argument based
	on reductions that neither the language nor its complement is recognizable.
