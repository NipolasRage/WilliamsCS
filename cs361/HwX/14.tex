Consider the {\sc Subset Sum} problem:  given a set of positive integers $X=\{x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\}$ and a positive integer $T$, we ask if there exists a subset $X' \subseteq X$ such that \[\sum_{x \in X'} x = T.\]  {\sc Subset Sum} is NP-complete.  Note that as stated this is a decision problem. The answer is yes or no rather than a list of numbers.

Show that if P=NP then you can use the polynomial time solution to the decision problem to give a polynomial time solution to the problem of actually finding the subset. Present pseudo-code describing the algorithm and
justify that it will have polynomial running time by giving an upper bound for its execution time under
the assumption that the decision problem can be solved in $O(p_d(n))$ time.

\begin{solution}

% Place your answers here
\begin{itemize}
	\item Let $S$ be an empty set
	\item While $T \ne 0$ and $|X| \ne 0$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item remove an $x_i$ from $X$ where $0\le i \le |X|$
		\item solve the decision problem using $X$ and $T-x_i$
		\item if the answer is yes
		\begin{itemize}
			\item add $x_i$ to $S$
			\item set $T = T - x_i$ 
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\item The set $S$ is a valid subset if one exists, and empty if no sum exists
\end{itemize}
This algorithm runs in polynomial time because the while loop will only run at most $|X|$ times. For every run, it will solve the decision problem. Thus, the runtime of this algorithm is $O(|X|p_d(n)) \in O(p_d(n))$
\end{solution}
