\textbf{Solution}
\\ This problem is in NP since a claimed set $\mathcal{P}$ of directed paths in $G$ can be checked to have $k$ pairwise vertex-disjoint paths in polynomial time. Since this appears to be a packing problem, letâ€™s try a reduction from Set Packing. An instance of Set Packing is a collection $S_{1}, . . . , S_{m}$ of subsets of a set $S={s_{1}, . . . , s_{n}}$ and an integer $k$; a solution is a collection $S_{i_{1}}, . . . , S_{i_{k}}$ of the sets, no two of which intersect.\\
To reduce this to the problem posted, imagine that we build a strongly connected graph $G = (V,E)$ where $V = S$. The collection of subsets $S_{1}, . . . , S_{m}$ corresponds to a collection of vertices $V_{1}, . . . , V_{m}$, where vertices in the same subset form a directed path. In this reduction a set $\mathcal{P}$ can be found. \\
We claim that a solution to Set Packing is "yes" if and only if a solution to the reduction is also "yes." Suppose we have a Set Packing solution $Y$ of at least $k$ subsets. Since the subsets are disjoint, the path they map to are pairwise vertex-disjoint. Conversely, each path $\mathcal{P}$ corresponds to a subset in an instance of Set Packing. These paths are vertex-disjoint, so the subsets must be disjoint as well.
