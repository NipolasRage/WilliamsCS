\textbf{Solution}
\\ The problem would more naturally be described as Subset Sum. This is because the price of the food could be associated to their weights and the budget of the customers as the target weight. Knapsack also worries about the value of elements. The customers do not value the appetizers as one being better than the other. They only worry about their price (weight).
